<h3>About Purchasing</h3>

<p>
    The University of California Davis does not have a standardized pre-purchasing process. Once orders are ready to be
submitted and executed a process exists for all units across campus within the Davis Financial Information System (DaFIS) and in the
new Kuali Financial System (KFS). Units across campus have various business practices and processes for performing pre-purchasing
functions but there is no campus standard.
</p>        
<p>The scope of this project is to deliver an application that can handle the pre-purchasing process. PrePurchasing allows users to submit any type of order request,
    including KFS, MyTravel, DPO/DRO/PR, and other campus services. This application also aids in the departmental approval process associated with approving order requests. 
    Seemless integration with DaFIS/KFS is expected in the near future.
</p>
        <p>
Note: The PrePurchasing web application will only be expected to handle departmental review of orders and will not replace any approvals within the campus
financial systems. Departmental approvals include supervisor and PI approval of an order. Account Managers provide review of
orders to ensure reliable and accurate data so that purchasers are able to provide campus financial systems with more complete data.
This system shall in no way replace any approvals required in KFS and approvals in this tool does not necessarily mean an order can
be purchased. This tool is designed to aid departments in organizing purchasing information to eliminate duplication of data entry in
the campus financial systems.</p>
