            <h3>New Features and Fixes since Beta1</h3>
            <p>Beta1 of PrePurchasing was released on April 1st, 2012. Our Beta users have provided great feedback and we have been hard at work adding new feautres and fixing bugs.</p>
            <p>A partial list of some of the more important/significant/most requested modifications follows:</p>

            <h3>*Save for later</h3>
            <p>While creating new orders you can now "Save For Later" your current progress so you can come back at any time and complete the order.  
                You can even optionally route your unsubmitted order to another person if you want them to submit it (for example, your computer person might input all technical info if you are purchasing a computer).</p>

            <h3>*Search for users by Kerb, Email, or Name</h3>
            <p>When looking up users, you can now just search by name if you don't know the user's kerberosID. However, please verify the kerbID is correct or search by email if you know that to ensure you aren't selecting a similarly named doppelganger</p>
