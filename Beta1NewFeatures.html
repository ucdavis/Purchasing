            <h3>New Features and Fixes since Beta1</h3>
            <p>Beta1 of PrePurchasing was released on April 1st, 2012. Our Beta users have provided great feedback and we have been hard at work adding new feautres and fixing bugs.</p>
            <p>A partial list of some of the more important/significant/most requested modifications follows:</p>
            <hr></hr><hr></hr>
            <h3>*Save for later</h3>
            <p>While creating new orders you can now "Save For Later" your current progress so you can come back at any time and complete the order.  
                You can even optionally route your unsubmitted order to another person if you want them to submit it (for example, your computer person might input all technical info if you are purchasing a computer).</p>

            <h3>*Search for users by Kerb, Email, or Name</h3>
            <p>When looking up users, you can now just search by name if you don't know the user's kerberosID. However, please verify the kerbID is correct or search by email if you know that to ensure you aren't selecting a similarly named doppelganger</p>
            <img src="images/Changelog/NameSearch.JPG" alt="search ldap name" class="half"></img>
            
            <h3>*Searchbox Visibility</h3>
            <p>You can now search inside your orders instantly from any page with the new persistent searchbox located in the upper-right corner. Take that Google.</p>
            <img src="images/Changelog/ordersearch.JPG" alt="search orders" class="half"></img>
            
            <h3>*Financial System Order Details</h3>
            <p>If you view an order that has been submitted to the campus finanical system we will now automatically load relevant details about the current status of that order.</p>

            <h3>*Order Details Simplification</h3>
            <p>It is now easier to navigate the options for providing account routing information. A simple horizontal set of buttons presents your options, with only the currently selected one visible at any time.</p>
            <img src="images/Changelog/orderdetailsaccount.JPG" alt="account select"></img>
            
            <h3>*Discover Users In A Workgroup</h3>
            <p>When you are looking through the order history, you can now peer into any [Workgroup] designation to see who currently has rights to make that action for the associated workgroup</p>
            <img src="images/Changelog/whocanact.jpg" alt="account select"></img>
            
            <h3>*Received Packages</h3>
            <p>TODO</p>
            
            <h3>*Administrative Workgroups</h3>
            <p>Administrative workgroups allow simple management of multiple workgroups within an organization without the need for individually adding users into each workgroup.  These workgroups are purely for rights to approve/edit/view order requests and requests are accessed through an administrative screen.  Shared Or Cluster workgroups takes this idea one step forward, by integrating these permissions with a user’s everyday tasks.  Orders displayed from a Shared Or Cluster workgroup will appear in the user’s screens (ex. Landing page) as if they were assigned directly to the workgroup and will also receive emails when requests arrive.</p>
            
            <h3>Misc</h3>
            <p>There were many other significant changes made since the April 1st Beta. You can view <a href="https://ucdavis.uservoice.com/forums/126891-purchasing/status/429176">our more than 40 completed tickets</a> for a comprehensive overview.  A few highlights:</p>
